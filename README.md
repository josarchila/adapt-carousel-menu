### Accessibility
Several menu-related elements are assigned a label using the [aria-label](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Aria-Labels) attribute: **ariaRegion**, **menuItem**, and **menuEnd**. These labels are not visible elements. They are utilized by assistive technology such as screen readers. Should the label texts need to be customised, they can be found within the **globals** object in [*properties.schema*](https://github.com/mike-st/adapt-carousel-menu/blob/master/properties.schema).   
<div float align=right><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

## Limitations
<div style="color:#990000;"><strong>If browser is zoomed in or out it may break the carousel Menu. Fix by returning browser zoom to 100%</strong></div>
